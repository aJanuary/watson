# Watson

A Discord bot for conventions.

The bot consists of several modules, which can be enabled or disabled in the configuration file.
Some of the modules can coordinate with a member portal via the member portal's API.

## Requirements
* Java 21 or above

## Modules

### Alarms
Allows users to set reminders for programme items (it requires the programme module to also be used).
The bot will add an emoji to each programme item message, which users can react to in order to set a reminder.
Shortly before the start time of the programme item the bot will send a message to the user in a private thread.

### API
Allows the bot to listen for messages in a specific channel and respond to them. Useful for providing a mechanism for
external services such as the member portal to interact with the bot without having to directly expose the bot via TCP
or HTTP.

The messages in the channel should contain JSON with a key `action`.

The currently supported actions are:
* `recheck-user`: Requests the bot to recheck the roles of a user. 
  Additional parameters: `user-id` - the ID of the user to recheck.

### Membership
Allows the bot to authenticate users and assign roles based on their membership status in a member portal.

When a user joins, the bot will send a request to the member portal to check their Discord id is associated with a
member. If it isn't, then it sends a private message to the user with a link to the member portal to connect their
Discord id with their membership.

The member portal can also send a list of roles to assign the user in the response.

### Programme
Allows the bot to post programme items from a JSON file to Discord.

The bot will create a forum post in a channel for each programme items. It will monitor the programme JSON for changes
and update the forum post. If the item's start time or room changes it will send a message to a major announcements
channel.

The bot can also send "Now on" messages when an item starts and remove them when the item ends.

The posts will be created in reverse start time order. When the forum channel is configured to show items in created
time order, the items will be ordered according to their start time. A limitation of this approach is that if the start
time changes, it will no longer be in the correct order.
